		<p1>The story starts in a very simple format. <br>
A man requires a transplant. The difference comes from the part of the body that is required in this operation. <br>
Normally you would assume that a kidney transplant was needed. Or maybe a heart transplant. But this was different. <br>
The type of transplant needed was a head. <br>
From all over the world, scientists and medical specialists were called over to embark in this endeavor. <br>
Evenetually, they came up with a working plan. <br>
But, it was flawed. <br>
Their biggest problem was connecting the spinal cord. <br>
They would only be able to connect it to the point that only 20% of it would be functional. <br>
This gave enough for simple movement but not enough for intellectual thought. <br>
It would leave the subject just like any other animal. <br>
It would survive on instinct alone. <br>
