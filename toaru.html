		<h1>Touma Anohana (incomplete)</h1>
		<div class="story">
		<p1>
			"Mou ii kai!" <br>
He yelled out with all of his might. <br>
"Mou ii kai!" <br>
He couldn't contain himself. <br>
With each scream, his control over his very own emotions began to slip. <br>
"MOu iiii Kaaii" <br>
His voice began to tremble as a wave of uncontrollable emotions began to overcome his very existence. He didn't care that he was guy. <br>
 He didn't care that the people of the streets were looking at him funny and talking behind his back. <br>
"mou ii kai" <br>
He couldn't yell it anymore, he was just about to give up when suddenly <br>
"Mada dayo!" <br>
He heard it. <br>
The response finally came! <br>
Just a few days ago, he wouldn't have believed, no. He wouldn't have even begun to imagine that he would be in the situation that he was in now. <br>
4 days before. <br>
"Touma!" <br>
"..." <br>
"Touma!!!" <br>
"hmmm" <br>
"TOUMAAAAA!!!" <br>
"What is it Index!? Can't you see that this poor Kamijou has to catch up with his make up homework!?" <br>
Kamijou Touma, there wasn't anybody who went to A Certain High School who didn't know that name. In fact, he had become so well known that people would even talk about him by name in places such as Tokiwadai Middle School. <br>
His Notoriety was not exactly for a good reason, it was one of Infamy. <br>
Why? You may ask. <br>
That's an easy one. <br>
This gentlemen here known as Kamijou Touma was none other than the story's protagonist! <br>
Wait, that's not right. <br>
What I meant to say was that he was the man who absorbed the bad luck of others. <br>
Or at least some hoped that was the reason for his ridiculous amount of bad luck. <br>
For example, having the bad grades that he had, Kamijou was also a bit of a slacker. <br>
It wasn't really his fault though. <br>
It's not that he avoided doing homework, or that he refused to do it in order to rebel against the system known as Academy City. <br>
No. <br>
He was just caught up in many situations that prevented him from attending class for several days. <br>
It seemed like instead of vacation being the minority in a students education, for Kamijou touma it was actually a majority. Though the reasons he didn't show up to school weren't because he was enjoying himself in Italy, or site seeing in England, or playing in the snow in Russia. <br>
Anyway, because of his bad grades and lack of attendance, it wouldn't be surprising if such a student was given make up work in order to catch up with the rest of the class. Hell, it wouldn’t be surprising that he was given extra work just so that he could have a chance to go on to the next year! <br>
Well as it turns out, Kamijou did not just have make up work. He had make up work for the make up work that he didn't complete because he was off fighting robots and protecting a magic god who had literally destroyed the world multiple times!!! <br>
When he awoke in that familiar hospital bed with that same familiar scene outside his window and inside, he thought to himself "all that suffering and pressure is gone." <br>
.....man was he wrong. <br>
Not only was he kept in the hospital longer than he would have liked, the reason he stayed there so long was because a certain magic god (or ex magic god) thought it would be fun to mess with a Nun with the peculiar name of Index. <br>
The result. (Hold your breath please) <br>
Yes, he was brutally chomped on by the final boss; Index. <br>
Wondering why it was him who got hurt and not the one who did the talking, Kamijou just shrugged it off with his usual misfortune.
It was sad, but he was used to being used as a chew toy by the silver haired foreigner. <br>
He was released. <br>
Well the hospital finally discharged him, and he was able to go home. But, he was a student. And as such, he had to attend class. <br>
It had been while since he had seen his teacher who was famous for looking like an elementary schooler. <br>
He hoped that she wouldn't make a big deal about his latest absences. <br>
But to his surprise, she didn't say a word to him before or during class. <br>
"Maybe she finally understands my mountain load of bad luck and decided to not be a part of that load" was what went through his mind. <br>
But, as expected he was wrong. <br>
He was told to wait after class. "Here comes the scolding" he said. <br>
Lucky for him, Tsuchimikado Motoharo and Aogami Pierce weren’t there to make some sort of witty remark about how jealous they were of him staying after school with their beloved teacher. <br>
SLAM! <br>
Paper, a lot of paper. <br>
So much in fact, that he was surprised that such a small person could carry all of it. <br>
It was the same height as Miss Komoe if not larger! <br>
Kamijou looked up with a face of disbelief. <br>
"Here is what you have to do to make up for the work you've missed" <br>
She said it with a smile so pure, but the intentions were everything but. <br>
"This is too large, it's a joke right?" trying to escape reality, Kamijou spoke. <br>
"It would have been less, but someone didn't turn in the previous make up assignments that he was given, so think of it as make up work for the work that you never made up for! Isn't it funny?" <br>
His expression went from disbelief to one of despair. <br>
He would have preferred to have been stabbed in the back by his teacher rather than to hear what he heard. <br>
"You have 7 days to turn it in, good luck!" <br>
Such Misfortune. <br>
<br>
"Touma!" <br>
"Yes Index-san" <br>
"Im hungry" <br>
"When aren't you?" <br>
"TOUMA!" <br>
"uhh- didn't we just eat?" <br>
"That was breakfast, it's time for Brunch" <Br>
"Brunch?" This was the first time Kamijou had hear that word. Knowing Index though, he guessed it had something to do with food and would work against him somehow. <br>
"In America and other countries you can go eat between breakfast and lunch: brunch" <br>
"Wait, that doesn't make sense" <br>
"hmm?" Index tilted her head to the side in confusion. <br>
"For many generations there has existed the 3 ideals of life; <br>
Breakfast: considered the most important meal of the day. <br>
Lunch: a crucial break during the day that works as a time to rest and a time to refuel for the continuous battle that is daily life. <br>
And. <br>
Dinner: a time of rest and relaxation, when you have finished the day's work and relax in the comfort of your home. <Br>
Why would you interrupt this peaceful and complete harmony that has been kept for centuries?" <br>
"3 Ideals, can't we just make them 4?" <br>
"No Index, are you the type of person who would go up to the government leaders and tell them 'there are so many laws already, why not add this one too?'" <br>
"hmmm" Index pouted. <br>
"Of course I wouldn't do that, and there are too many laws. Instead of adding more laws, we should be subtracting a few." She said matter of factly. <br>
