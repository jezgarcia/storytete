		<h1>The Unknown Dark Swordsman</h1>
		<div class="story">
		<p1>He tried to run around it, throwing daggers with his left hand and holding a sword with his right hand. The daggers had little effect, but they did their job; distracting and startling the opponent. <br>
He quickly dashed towards the monster in an attempt to finish it off. <br>
But he failed. <br>
It wasn’t that he didn’t hit his opponent. But rather, he did hit the monster, cutting him across the chest. <br>
The problem was that the wound he inflicted was too shallow. The monster had moved away enough to avoid its death. <br>
The monster had a .000005% chance of spawning. It loved to sneak up on its victims. And as if to add to its rarity, if it’s sneak attack succeeded, its speed and strength would increase 1.3 times its normal stats. <br>
The monster laughed at him. <br>
Or at least it looked like it did. The monster was called Robin the Bandit. It had a human like silhouette, but had a unique way of standing. It always had its knees slightly bent, and leaned back in a way that if you blocked out his upper body with your hand from the torso to the nape of the neck, you wouldn’t be able to tell he was leaning. He used daggers as his main weapon, and his stance made it easy for him to use them. The monster’s face always wore a smile as if mocking you. <br>
Robin the Bandit was as strong as a field boss, and had succeeded with its sneak attack. The boy was in trouble. He had half of his health left and had already used his favorite distraction. <br>
But he wasn’t weak, and he was always alert. <br>
Normally, a sneak attack wouldn’t have worked against him, but this time was different. <br>
He was walking, lost in thought. Or to be more accurate, he was thinking about if he should visit his friend. <br>
She was a blacksmith who had a shop he frequented. <br>
He didn’t want to annoy her, which is why he was wondering if enough days had passed since his last visit, when he was suddenly brought back from his thoughts by a cut to his back. <br>
“Guess I’ll put in more effort” he sighed as he decided to end the fight with his next move. <br>
He switched his sword to his left hand. He crouched down going into his own unique stance, left foot forward, right foot ready to kick off the ground, and his sword held in his right side. His left arm held across his body holding the sword in a low position by his waist, and his right hand behind the sword. <br>
He didn’t want to use this technique because it was something he created, thus the system didn’t help him carry out the attack. <br>
He had to focus and do everything himself. <br>
He dashed forward toward the bandit once again and swung his left arm across as if to slash upwards. <br>
The monster was quick. <br>
Still with his twisted smirk, it moved both hands forward in order to block. <br>
But... <br>
Nothing was blocked. <br>
Although the bandits speed was perfect, there was nothing to block. <br>
The boy had swung his left hand, but he had let go of the sword and only used the movement of his arm as a feint. <br>
He caught the sword with is right hand, and cut the monster in two. <br>
“Laugh at that, bastard” said the boy. <br>
His smirk gone, the Bandit broke into a million little pieces and disappeared. <br>
“I guess I’ll visit Liz after all.” The boy sheathed his sword and continued on his way. <br>
----------------------------- <br>
His name was Kosuke, Kosuke Touguto. <br>
Though most people around him didn’t know him by that name. <br>
Here, where he was, he went by Tosuke. <br>
Tosuke was currently in a world known as Sword Art Online, SAO for short. It was an online virtual reality game. The first real VRMMORPG.
A little over a year ago, when it was released, everybody who was logged on (10,000 people) became unable to log out. Unable to escape the game until all 100 floors of the castle known as Aincrad were cleared. <br>
The first couple of weeks were hell, if you died in the game, you died in real life. These words caused terror and confusion amongst the players when the GM(game master) spoke them all those months ago. <br>
Among the confusion, some people didn’t believe they would die, there were many suicides among them. <br>
Tosuke, on the other hand, believed it right away after seeing he news clips shown by the GM. <br>
It was tough at first. Because he had logged on alone, Tosuke had no friends here. Tosuke was never very social even as Kosuke Touguto, thus he had very few friends. And even though he was in an online game, he still wasn’t very good at making friends and socializing. <br>
But, he ran into someone early in the game, her name here is Lisbeth. The blacksmith friend he had with whom he likes to talk to. <br>
He didn’t go a week without visiting her at least once. In fact, he was on his way to visit her at her shop right now. <br>
When they met, Tosuke was in a dungeon somewhere in the 6th floor fighting solo, when he saw a girl on the ground being attacked by a goblin. Tosuke, confident in his skills, ran to her rescue cutting down the goblin. What he didn’t know was that the girl was losing only because there were two goblins attacking her and she didn’t know how to handle two opponents. Tosuke was hit from behind by the other goblin who, until now, he couldn’t see. In which case, it was the girls turn to save the day; she smashed the goblin with her mace. And that’s how he met Liz. <br>
Until this day, she reminds him of how careless he was. <br>
Having arrived to his destination, Tosuke opened the door to the shop, a little bell ringing as he entered. <br>
“Liz!” he shouted. <br>
“The coolest person you know is here!” <br>
“Haha you wish!” was the response Tosuke barely managed to make out. <br>
Laughter could be heard followed by footsteps, slowly getting louder and louder. Until a girl with pink hair popped out from the doorway that lead to the back of the store, where the weapons were most likely made. <br>
“It’s been a while Tosuke, what have you been up to?” Tosuke couldn’t help notice the smile she always greeted him with and a smile formed on his face too. <br>
“The usual, I almost died thanks to you though!” <br>
“What!? How!!!” A genuinely concerned expression appeared on Lisbeth’s face. <br>
“Yeah, I was walking through a field thinking about uh…” he hesitated for a moment. <br>
“Thinking about how if I should get you to check up on my sword, when I was attacked by a rare monster! I lost half of my health with just two attacks!”
“What!? How?” <br>
“The monster had a special ability that increased its speed and attack after a successful sneak attack.” Tosuke explained. <br>
“Damn, you’re unlucky, what are the odds of running into one of those? Haha, and don’t blame me for your own stupidity! It’s not my fault you don’t pay attention!” <br>
“Excuse me, did you say something?” <br>
“Tosuke!!!” Lisbeth threw a punch at Tosuke, but he got out of the way. <br>
“Hahaha, I was joking. Calm down, calm down.” <br>
Liz crossed her arms and moved her head to the side with a hmph sound. <br>
“Jerk” she muttered. <br>
She looked at him and started smiling again. <br>
“How have you been Liz? You seem to be as lively as ever” <br>
“Just about the same I guess, oh! I just finished what I consider to be my best sword ever!” She had her hand on her cheek and then raised her finger pointing at the sword. <br>
“Cool, can I see it?” <br>
Liz agreed and handed the sword over to him. <br>
“Whoa, it’s light. Not that I’m a fan of heavy swords.” Tosuke swung the sword a couple of times and looked at it. <br>
“It feels stronger than your other swords, not my style though. Did you make this for Asuna?” <br>
“Not specifically, but it is a sword meant for someone like her” <br>
“I like mine better” Tosuke pulled out his sword from its sheath and showed it off. It was a dark color, black to be exact, and shone orange when swung. It was second only to one. Its name was Shadow Destroyer. <br>
Lisbeth received the sword from Tosuke. <br>
“I still can’t believe you have the second strongest sword you can get as a monster drop. I’d call you lucky if I didn’t know any better” <br>
"Wow, thanks" <br>
"I’ll give it some maintenance; in the meantime, you can go get lost somewhere." <br>
"But you’d miss me if I got lost, haha" <br>
"Yeah right!"" Said Liz sarcastically. <br>
"Alright, you look busy, so I’ll walk around town for a bit." <br>
