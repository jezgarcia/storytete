		<h1>In the Process of Death</h1>
		<div class="story">
		<p1>The boy was walking down the usual street that he always takes to school. Walking a good distance of about a mile. <br>
He didn't walk from home to school though, the distance was simply too much and it would take him over a day to reach the campus on foot.<br>
That's why he owned a car. <br>
He drove an average of 30mins to school every morning. <br>
The campus was large though, this is why he had to walk even though he had a car. Plus, the parking garage he used was far. It was the only one open at the time when he purchased a parking permit. <br>
And so, every morning his day started the same way. Wake up, get ready, eat, drive through traffic, park, and walk. <br>
He was in the walking part of his everyday routine. <br>
In order to get to his destination, the boy traveled past 3 traffic lights. <br>
He had already made it past the first and was in the process of passing the second. Or rather, he was closing in on the traffic light in order to be able to cross it. <br>
The boy had gotten used to his new life after graduating highschool over a year ago. <br>
He was now labeled an "adult". <br>
Although he, like many others, didin’t feel like an adult and wasn’t ready to take up such a huge responsibility. <br>
Nonetheless, he was an "adult". <br>
19 <br>
That's his age. <br>
Proof of having lived over a year as someone who was no longer a child in society. <br>
Still, that wasn't nearly enough to make him be able to handle the responsibilities of being a contributing member of society. <br>
Anyway. <br>
He was used to walking like this every morning. <br>
He was used to stressing out during midterms and finals. <br>
He was used to being unsure of his future. <br>
He was just used to the life he had been living all this time. <br>
SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECCCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! <br>
THUMP! <br>
"That's weird... The world turned to its side." <br>
"This has never happened before, it's kind of interesting." <br>
Let me explain. <br>
The boy was walking the usual distance through the same path he has used for months now. <br>
It can happen at any time though. <br>
While crossing the second crosswalk to school, a car hit him. <br>
There was a screech as if the driver tried to hit the brakes, but the car didn't slow down even a little bit. <br>
It hit the boy's left side with full force. <br>
Although the boy seems to only have seen the scene in front of him turn to its side, he knows how he got hit. He remembers seeing it in slow motion.
The car made contact with the left side of his body, mostly below the waist, but just barely. His upper body quickly moved to the left and hit the car, while his bottom half moved to the right due to the direction it was pushed. His head made contact with the car and he rolled over it. His body twisting in ways that he would have never imagined before. But, during this whole process, his mind was working at an abnormal speed.
Moving back the beginning of the impact, the boy thought it was strange how his view changed so drastically. <br>
"Oh yeah, I just got hit by a car" <br>
".............." <br>
"Man this is taking long" <br>
"........." <br>
"Hey, don't they say that when you’re about to die your life flashes before your eyes?" <br>
"I wonder if it's true" <br>
"........." <br>
"Nope, no life flashing before my eyes." <br>
"Maybe what they meant was that when you’re dying you have so much time to think, because everything feels so slow in those moments that you start thinking about your past in order to pass the time.” <br>
"How was my life?" <br>
".....hmm..." <br>
He imagined himself in a thinking position, since he obviously wouldn’t be able to move in the position when he is being involuntarily sent flying with irregular body movements. <br>
"I'd say it was normal, just so I won't sound like if I'm whining." <br>
"Though, it's hard to come up with a happy memory right here and now..." <br>
"Was I happy???" <br>
"I don't think I was overjoyed about life, but was I depressed?" <br>
"Discontent?" <br>
"Wait, does it really matter?" <br>
"Why think like that now that I'm practically dead?"" <br>
"Hmm... maybe I should think of a happy memory to take with me to the afterlife. That may put me at peace and help pass the time until I finalliy kick the bucket." <br>
"Think reeeeaaalllllyyyyy hard now, what is a happy memory?" <br>
"......." <br>
"Nope, nothing..." <br>
"Maybe a dream?" <br>
"I do remember a dream where I spoke to a classmate. It was a nice dream;"" <br>
I was sitting in a classroom…. It was empty... <br>
Except, there was another student there, and she and I started to talk. <br>
We spoke about many things, or maybe just one thing, I don't really know what was said, nor do I remember what the subjects we spoke about were. In fact, I'm sure that the dream never specified anything about what we spoke about. Instead, there was just the feeling of having a nice long conversation with someone. It was a conversation where neither side held back, like two people who hate each other and will say everything they come up with to destroy their opponent. But our conversation was anything but hateful, we just spoke to each other without restraint. I would laugh, and she would laugh. Then she would get really into explaining something, and I would laugh at how intense she got. Then I would do the same, and her response mocked me with a friendly grin. <br>
"Yup, that's a great dream." <br>
"Dying here while holding on to this dream might not be too bad." <br>
"Though, it's kind of sad that the only thing I'm considering to take with me from my life is something that never happened." <br>
"It's just a dream." <br>
He felt a little disappointed at not finding an event in his life that really stuck out. <br>
A dream. <br>
That's all he could come up with. <br>
He had to think more. <br>
A lot more. <br>
He had the time, it's not like he was late for class or anything like that. <br>
Well, even if he was, I don't think he’d be able to make it even if he tried. <br>
Still, a good memory. Something that made him feel like if he was alive. Something thing that made him feel like it was ok to live. <br>
"hm" <br>
The boy thought up a smirk. <br>
If he could make an expression, that half smile would be the one to show up on his face. <br>
"It's kind of funny that I'm looking for something that made me feel alive now that I'm most likely not going to be alive for much longer." <br>
Though he had already gone through this in the beginning, he still couldn't believe how slow everything was going. <br>
He had been hit almost 40 minutes ago! <br>
Well, that's how it felt anyway. <br>
He started thinking about all the shows he would never see end, and all the things he would never be able to experience. <br>
Funny, he even started thinking about food. <br>
He was getting hungry.<br>
Food is something that not a lot of people see as a luxury. <br>
To them, it's ordinary. They have to have the best meat with the best sauces. But sometimes the plainest foods are the most delicious. <br>
 At least, that's what he thought. Be then again, that was just his taste. He didn't like high class fancy food. He preferred regular food anybody can make. <br>
"Man, I'm gonna miss eating" <br>
Then suddenly it finally came to him. <br>
The memory he couldn't find earlier. <br>
The thing that made him feel alive. <br>
Something that most people take for granted. <br>
It was when he had those bad days, and walked around. He would walk and walk, then some day he stumbled upon a certain place. What would you call it? He didn't know, maybe some sort of garden? <br>
Anyway, the place was surrounded by trees. Trees that blocked the sun and isolated that place from the rest of the world. It was an amphitheater type place, were there were large steps sinking lower and lower as you approached the middle. <br>
He sat down there a lot. <br>
He would think, and sometimes he would just sit down and enjoy the quiet. <br>
Here, all his troubles were gone. <br>
Here, all of his stress and uncertainty were gone. <br>
Here he was able to feel at peace. <br>
"Yeah, this is the memory I would like to take with me." <br>
------------ <br>
Later in the report, there was a witness who said they saw him smiling in midair, right before he hit the ground. <br>
Strange, why was he smiling? <br>
<hr>
Hope you liked it. <br>
Tete's Note! <br>
This idea came to me out of nowhere, at least that’s what I'd like to say, but it came from many events happening in my life (not bad one's). <br>
Then, one day, <br>
SMACK! <br>
INSPIRATION!!!! <br>
Haha anyway, if you liked it please review. <br>
If you didn't like it, please review aswell! <br>
