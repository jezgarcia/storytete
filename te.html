			Prologue: <br> 
			<br>
It was February 22. <br>
Something new and dangerous began on this day. <br>
9:30 pm Phoenix, Arizona. <br>
There was a change for an inhabitant of the city. <br>
A young 17 year old high school student experienced a change in his regular routine. <br>
The night had reached a certain darkness unique to that date. <br>
It’s quiet. <br>
It was so quiet that it would make you feel uncomfortable from the lack of sound. All of the birds had gone to sleep already, so there was no chirping. People weren’t making any loud noises from inside of their homes. Nobody was outside. Strangely, you couldn’t even hear any cars from the main road. And what was even weirder was that you couldn’t even hear the sound of the crickets.
This unusual quiet was interrupted by the sound of footsteps. <br>
They were rushed. <br>
It was obvious to anybody who could hear these steps that the person creating them was being rushed. Or maybe they were desperately trying to escape? <br>
Regardless, someone was running at full speed. <br>
“Why am I running?” He thought to himself. <br>
The person who ran at night surrounded by the most unusual quiet didn’t understand why he was running. <br>
It was evident that he was the reason that he was running. <br>
I mean, he is the only one in control of his body. The only one who could send the commands to the muscles of his legs to create the motions that resulted in what was referred to as running. <br>
But, he didn’t know why he had to run. <br>
He considered himself as someone who had a normal life. He encountered regular problems and situations. But the moment he looked down and saw his shirt, he knew something was wrong. <br>
There was blood, and it wasn’t necessarily a small amount. At the moment the boy knew it was time to say goodbye to the day he enjoyed as being “normal.” <br>
<center>.......................................End of prologue.......................................</center> <br>
Chapter 1 <br>
<br>
-The Regular Day- <br> 
<br>
This story begins with a question. Is there anybody who is truly normal? <br>
To come up with an answer we should probably figure out what “normal” is. <br>
It’s normal to eat. Yes indeed it is. <br>
But, nobody will consider you normal if you eat. <br>
They will analyze how and what you eat in order to determine if you are normal or not. <br>
But what if you like different foods? <br>
Or if you cook it differently? <br>
Who is the abnormal one? <br>
The one analyzing? <br>
Or the one being analyzed? <br>
The word “normal” is something difficult to explain. Human beings don’t tend to explain it with words. But I guess you could say normal is what most people have in common. Majority rules. <br>

The main character of this story never considered himself normal. Although, there was a time when he didn’t consider the idea of normal and abnormal. <br>
He was a child then. <br>
The reason he didn’t consider himself normal, abnormal, or anything a like, was because the question hadn’t popped up in his head.
Just like when you are asked about what you would like to eat tomorrow…”Well, I never really thought about it yet” would probably be the most common response. <br>
As such, because he had never thought about it before, he couldn’t possibly have an opinion in that matter. The same way that there is no answer if a question hasn’t been asked. <br>
Back to the point! <br>
The main character never considered himself normal. But, that didn’t necessarily mean that he thought of himself as special. In fact, he never considered himself special. The same way that he never considered himself normal.
But what would that make him? <br>
He was neither normal nor special. <br>
He was just himself…I guess? <br>
Maybe seen from the outside, he would be considered normal, but his thoughts could never be monitored. <br>
A serial killer could emerge from the insides of a “normal” person and cause mass destruction. But talk to those who knew them and they would say “he was normal before this happened.” <br>
Let’s make this clear. <br>
Our main character is not a serial killer. <br>
He won’t suddenly begin killing people and develop some sort of hobby that includes grotesque acts of violence. <br>
No. <br>
He isn’t that type of person. <br>
Normal? Abnormal? Special? <br>
Some may say that the events approaching our main character are everything but normal. You could even call him special due to these events, but our main character is not special. <br>
He is just happened to run into a series of events. <br>
------------------- <br>
Waking up in the morning by an alarm is something all students experience. <br>
But, Levi Suprime did not wake up to his alarm. <br>
It wasn’t because the alarm never went off, because it did. <br>
The alarm played “The Reluctant Heroes” from the SNK OST. <br>
He just so happened to wake up before his alarm went off. <br>
Levi didn’t make it a habit to wake up before his alarm woke him up, it almost never happened. But when it did happen, nothing really came from it. Although, every time he did wake up like how he had today he was filled with a huge feeling of uneasiness. <br>
He would usually ignore it though, since nothing ever happens. Maybe he forgot to do his homework? <br>
Levi got ready to head out to school. Among the many things he did in the morning before heading out, there was the time for food. 
<br> 
Eating. <br>
Since he had woken up earlier than usual, and didn’t have to hit snooze on his alarm like 5 times, the 17 year old boy decided to cook for himself. <br>
He wasn’t a super good cook, he hardly cooked anything that didn’t involve an egg. But, since it was early in the morning, breakfast food was the right thing to make and luckily that involved eggs most of the time. <br>
As he began preparing his breakfast, Levi starting thinking about what he had to do that day. <br>
Levi was a high school student who was currently in his last year. He had already taken the national test taken by all high schools students that were sent to Universities last year. This year all he had to do was make sure he didn’t screw up his GPA. <br>
One would think that since he was in his last year in high school, as a student he would have a lot of work to do, busy with classes, assignments, exams, and other activities in preparation for graduation and what came afterword. But, that wasn’t the case. Although he wasn’t a perfect student, the first couple of years in high school he got exceptionally good grades. As long as he passed all his classes this semester, he would easily graduate in the top 25% of his class. <br>
School wasn’t something he looked forward too, but he did enjoy the atmosphere it had. It was so carefree and relaxed. <br>
Having washed the dishes used after his meal, Levi took hold of his backpack and headed off to school. <br>
------------------- <br>
Valley High School was a public school that apart from being a high school that covered all of the requirements for learning standards in the State, it also had a great system of extra-curricular courses to learn new tasks that could land you a job after completing them. <br>
Construction, auto mechanics, accounting, architecture, Advertising and Design, Flower arrangements, Early childhood education, engineering, etc... <br>
Among all of those, it was rare if you didn’t find something that interested you. <br>
This school was filled with students who were able to explore careers they never even dreamt of before. Still, even though it sounded great, not a lot of people worked in jobs that required what they had learned. <br>
Fernando was a man of many dreams. <br>
So many dreams that he found himself stuck sometimes when he couldn’t pick what to do. <br>
When those times came, he would just calm down and pick the very first thing that came to mind. And then, he would pursue that dream. That would normally be great and all, but there is always something that stopped him. <br>
He would quit halfway through. <br>
He would start learning the basics of building a small shed and get as far as building half of it. <br>
But then. <br>
He suddenly decided that it was time to pursue his dream in video editing. <br>
That’s where he was currently. <br>
He was taking a video editing class, and had become familiar with using Adobe After Affects, Sony Vegas, and other editing tools. But, like always, he was going to switch to something else soon. <br>
Fernando has just gotten close enough to see the front of the school when he spotted his friend. <br>
“Levi!” <br>
------------------ <br>
Levi was nearing the gates of his school when someone called out to him. <br>
When he turned around he spotted his friend Fernando. <br>
“Yo, what’s up?” <br>
“Nothing much, just wondering why you have such a serious face today” <br>
Levi considered himself to be great at keeping a straight face that didn’t show any sort of emotion. <br>
But, it seemed that sometimes those who saw him every day did notice his changes in facial expression. <br>
“I’m just wondering if we had any homework due today” <br>
“No, I don’t think so. Why? Did you have a dream about not turning in your homework and not being able to graduate?” <br>
“haha no, I doubt someone would not graduate just for missing one assignment” <br>
“You never know, I’m sure if we think about it long enough, we can come up with 5 ways easily!” <br>
“Oh really? Like what?” <br>
“Imagine a teacher who only has one assignment throughout the whole course and its worth 40% of your grade so even if you ace all of your exams you would still fail” <br>
“Wow…” <br>
“What? Did you really not believe that it wouldn’t be possible even if hypothetical?” <br>
“No, it’s just that you said something that could actually be plausible, I was expected something more outrageous or utterly impossible.” <br>
“Well, that was actually my 5th idea. My first was an evil overlord cat controls the president and somehow gets large influence to congress and succeeds in passing a law that requires all assignments to be turned in or else you will be sentenced to 9 months in the back alleys living like an alley cat in order to understand the pain of the cat overlord in his dark days.” <br>
“Wow...” <br>
“What’s wrong now!?” <br>
“Well, just that that was surprisingly not as serious as I expected” <br>
“Bueno pues, que quieres?” (well then, what do you want?) <br>
Their talk continued and the other 3 scenarios were very... unique. <br>
The bell rang letting the students know that class will start in 5 minutes. Fernando and Levi headed to their first period and sat down in their seats awaiting for their class to start. <br>
That whole day in school was normal and Levi eventually forgot about the unpleasant feeling he was having since that morning. <br>
--------- <br>
Locating the target was the easiest part of the job. <br>
Gathering information was a simple task made even simpler with the information network and connections that came from being a part of the “organization.” <br>
But, the reason it was so easy was because of how skilled she was at everything she tried. <br>
She was a fast learner, someone who caught on by just observing and giving it a try. <br>
Of course, she wouldn’t admit to that. <br>
She had a great teacher. <br>
That was it. <br>
He was indeed skilled, more so than she was. He was recognized by the several organizations other than the one they belonged to. The most amazing part was his age, 25. An age where some people are barely leaving school life and entering the world of the “adults.” But this man was fearsome. <br> 
It didn’t matter how old you were, because to him, he had the wisdom of someone who had at least lived for twice as long. <br>
Having been distracted, Lyra came back to her current mission and observed. <br>
The target was currently located in their house. <br>
The location was slightly North West of what was considered the central part of the city. <br>
She had to keep watch for a while until a good opportunity presented itself for contact. <br>
Lyra(Naomi?) was unusually not as attentive tonight. She felt slightly nervous and couldn’t concentrate like normal. <br>
The normally calm and collected rising expert was shaken for some reason. <br>
“Looks like their taking out the trash” she thought to herself as she observed. <br>
The trash was collected in an alley located behind the house. These alleys tended to be lit up by a faint light coming from a lamppost- that’s when she noticed. <br>
“WAIT!!! Damn! I messed up” she lowered her binoculars and took out her phone. <br>
“There’s a problem” she spoke into the phone. <br>
These alleys tended to bit lit up even if only slightly, but the alley she was looking at had no light at all. She didn’t know how she didn’t notice earlier, it was the perfect opportunity and she let it happen. <br>
“No use worrying about it now” said the voice on the other side of the line, as if he knew she had slipped up. <br>
“Move out” <br>
Lyra did as she was told and left her comfortable hiding spot. <br>
It was time to make contact, though not the way they had wanted. <br>
And so the first grain dropped from the ever still hourglass. <br>
------------ <br>
<br>
It was time to walk home and man was it starting to get hot. <br>
Phoenix was a place that hade an ideal winter to some, and a horrible summer for all. <br>
It wasn’t even summer yet, but the temperature was already reaching 95 degrees Fahrenheit. <br>
Plus, the city was known for being bipolar about its temperatures. One day it was hot, the next it was cold. Sometimes the morning had sweater weather, and the afternoon you were burning alive. <br>
Today it was just hot. <br>
There wasn’t even the nice cold breeze that there was sometimes during this time of year. <br>
It took Levi 25 minutes to walk from the school gate to his house. Those were 25 minutes of enduring the heat coming from the sun. 
<br>
Even though he was born in raised in this crazy inferno, he hadn’t gotten used to it yet. <br>
There probably wasn’t such a thing as getting used to the heat. It was more like those who lived here, after a certain amount of time gave up trying to even complain and just lived with the heat. <br>
Only a little bit more. <br>
Levi’s house was around just passing the huge trees that was considered a safe haven thanks to the shade that it gave. <br>
He was almost there, and he could almost feel the air conditioning from his house already. <br>
When he finally reached the place, everything felt like it was alright. <br>
“I can die in peace now” Levi thought out loud. <br>
There wasn’t much to do at home. <br>
After making sure he had done all of his assignments that were due soon, Levi took his time reading and watching some shows. <br>
There wasn’t anything specific that he liked to watch, or that he followed. <br>
He felt that his lack of interest to television shows made him different from those in his school. He always heard them talk about a show that they all liked or how interesting another show was. But Levi never really participated in those conversations. <br>
His hobby was reading. <br>
He read novels. Some classic, others sci-fi or fantasy. He also enjoyed reading foreign comics.<br>
And so, during his down time, he spent it all mostly reading. <br>
Even though he was home alone most of the time during these days, he didn’t really mind it because of the quiet that came with it and the possibility to read in peace. <br>
He had just finished a novel about an adventurer who went into a dungeon in order to make a name for himself and attract the ladies. Although the title could mislead you into thinking that there was only going to be about some desperate guy trying to talk to girls, it was nothing like that. <br>
There was a lot of character development and Levi liked that the most, because he felt like he was going through the experiences with the characters. <br>
This story was going to stay on his mind for a while, they always did. <br>
He was definitely going to go through possible future scenarios in his head. <br>
Levi decided to take out the trash since it had gotten dark outside. <br>
Even though most don’t notice, if left alone, the trash in his house could easily pile up and leave a horrible smell that could be noticed throughout the whole house. <br>
And so he did just that, carrying the garbage bag in one hand then went to the dark back alley that was located behind his house to dispose of the trash. <br>
It was after he had gotten rid of the bag that he noticed that his uneasy feeling came back. <br>
Like being struck by a wave in the ocean when you weren’t paying any attention to it. <br>
His heart started beating at an incredible rate. His stomach felt uncomfortable and his mind began jumping all over the place. <br>
Why is this happening? What’s going on? And Why now? These thoughts ran through his mind then he finally noticed. He felt a presence behind him. <br>
He doesn’t know how he knew they were there, but he just knew. <br>
Two of them, they were huge. <br>
Levi wasn’t exactly the tallest guy out there, but he was definitely not the shortest either. But these guys still towered over him by a head. <br>
It wasn’t just their height either. The two men were well built too. They looked like some sort of professional wrestlers. <br>
They were wearing black suits with a green dress shirt. <br>
Levi didn’t have it in him to ask why there were matching. But he was able to squeeze out a “who are you guys.” <Br>
But they didn’t answer his question. Instead, they said “Levi, you’re coming with us.” <br>
There was so much intimidation in their tone of voice, Levi knew that they were probably trying to kidnap him. <br>
But why? <Br>
Levi didn’t exactly hang around with a lot of people, nor did he hang out in the city. So how could he have gotten involved into something that was obviously not good? <Br>
The two men started moving towards him, Levi couldn’t make a dash towards his house, because the two men were in the way. <Br>
He got so caught up in thinking about what was the reason for this and how he was going to escape that he didn’t even notice how close they had gotten to him already, and just when he was going to make a break for it, they grabbed his arm. <br>
Levi wasn’t nearly as physically built as the two men so there was no way he could just pull his hand away. So he gave up on thinking about things normally. <br>
He grabbed the arm that was holding onto his and jumped off the floor directing his heels towards the man’s stomach. At least, that was the plan. Even though he did make contact with something, it was the guy’s other hand that he used to catch his foot and prevent any kind of damage. <br>
Damn. He thought that would work. <br>
The man looked at him with the same face he had on since he had gotten there. There was no anger nor any sort of emotion shown on his face. It was as if he was trained to keep a strictly profession expression at all times. The same could be said about his buddy who was next to him. <br>
Levi planted his feet on the floor as soon as stranger let go of his foot. <br>
Should he try something else? Hitting him with his elbow maybe? <br>
No, the man looked pretty strong and that probably wouldn’t hurt him enough to have him let go, plus what just happened proved that he was ready for any sort of resistance he would show. <br>
So he gave up and stopped thinking. <br>
His mind went blank and he got closer to the man. <br>
“Let us go then” The other man said taking the few steps Levi took as a sort of surrender. <br>
But what Levi gave up on doing wasn’t resisting, he gave up on trying to think about what he should do next. <br>
Like a rabbit running away from its predator, Levi bolted in the opposite direction. <br>
He ran as fast as he could. <br>
He ran into a concrete wall which he easily jumped over. <br>
He kept running and running, he didn’t even know if he was being pursued. <br>
It didn’t matter, he just had to run. <br>
His mind had gone blank for just a second. <br>
It brought back horrible memories. <br>
Many of you may be asking: how did he escape? Weren’t the two guys too strong for him to just pull his arm away? <br>
That’s true, he couldn’t have escaped by just pulling his arm with all of his strength. <br>
What had happened was two quick and unexpected actions. <br>
The first was something that came into Levi’s mind, the first thing that came to his mind. <br>
He remembered that there was a point in the lower part of the ribs that is also in between them that no muscle grew (or at least it was hard to train) and that the bones of one’s ribs couldn’t cover. <br>
This spot could leave you feeling uncomfortable if poked, and left you feeling as if you could have trouble breathing if you did more than poke. <br>
If just poking gave you that feeling, what would happen if you jammed two fingers there with all of your strength? <br>
The result was an opening that allowed Levi to slip his hand away from the man who was trying to kidnap him. <br>
That was a success and all, but there were two of them. <br>
Even though he had succeeded in freeing himself from one of them, there was still the guy’s friend who was right next to him. <br>
What was he to do if that guy went after him? <br>
Nothing. <br>
The other guy caught him as he tried to escape. There was no way he could escape from this other guy. <br>
The same trick wasn’t going to work twice. <br>
That’s when his mind went blank. <br>
That is why his shirt was stained with blood. <br>
It was the blood of the man who caught him, the one he ran away from. <br>
When his mind went blank he didn’t remember what he did, but he knew he did something. <br>
That was when his uneasiness reached the boiling point. <br>
He managed to escape, but at the same time Levi felt as if he did something he didn’t want to do. <br>
------------- <br>
After having ran for some time, Levi finally came to a stop. <br>
He was in a neighborhood he had never been to before. <br>
The place had a dead silence that would creep anyone out. But it wasn’t nearly late enough for it to be so quiet. In fact, it never really got that quiet in the city. You could always hear something if you paid close attention. But right now it was really quiet.
<br>
The silence let him hear slight movement coming from his left. <br>
He couldn’t see too well since it was dark, but he could make out a thin silhouette. <br>
As the figure got closer, there was another noise this time to his right. <br>
Same thing happened, he could see that someone was approaching. <br>
Seeing that there were two of them, Levi began to think that it was the two thugs who he thought he had successfully escaped from. 
<br>
Just as he was getting ready to make his move, he heard a voice call out to him. <br>
“Don’t run, we’re not with the guys who you saw earlier.” <br>
The voice came from a man who he could see now. He looked like he was somewhere between his mid twenty’s and gave off a presence of someone who knew just about everything. <br>
The other silhouette was now in the form of a girl. She looked around the same age as Levi and had long black hair. <br>
The two people didn’t exactly look like they were trying to kidnap them, and they looked just like any other people their age would look like.<br>
Levi’s uneasiness was gone and so he relaxed a little. <br>
“You’re probably wondering why you were being chased by two strangers.” <br>
“....” <br>
“We came to help you out, we work against the people who tried to kidnap you.” <br>
Levi looked at them trying his best to keep his face looking indifferent. <br>
The two noticed that he wasn’t really responding to their words so the guy asked. <br>
“Do you know what city you’re in?” <br>
Levi reacted in a way in which his whole expression said “What?” but he didn’t udder a word. <br>
After a bit, he did respond. <br>
“I’m in Phoenix.” <br>
“You were in Phoenix.” <br>
Levi was confused, what did he mean he was in Phoenix? <br>
He couldn’t be implying that he ran for such a long time that he was located in the cities that were connected to Phoenix like Glendale. <br>
“What do you mean?” Levi asked. <br>
He didn’t think it was possible as he was sure that he didn’t even run for 15 minutes straight. There was no way he could make it that far even if it was close by car. <br>
“While it’s true that you didn’t run for a long time, you did make it quiet far.” <br>
“!!!???” <br>
“This is Chandler” <br>
“!!!!!!!!!!!!?” <br>
Levi was aghast. <br>
How was that possible? Chandler was at least a 30 min drive away from his house. And that was only if there wasn’t many cars on the road and if you took the freeway all the way there. <br>
By foot it would definitely take him more than 4 hours to get there. Plus, Chandler was located the opposite direction he was running. He ran northwest of his house while Chandler was south east of where he lived. <br>
“If you don’t believe us take a look around you” The girl finally spoke. <br>
He did just as he was told, the traffic lights did look slightly different. But maybe that was just how they looked right here. <br>
As he looked around he spotted another sign. There was no mistake that it read “Chandler.” <br>
But how? There was no way someone could make it that far in such a short time by foot. Sure, Levi was considered a pretty fast runner, but this was just ridiculous. So he asked “do you know how I got here?” <br>
The two strangers were shocked. They weren’t expecting him to ask such a question. <br>
“You catch on quick. And yes, we do know why.” <br>
It wasn’t that Levi was some super smart guy, he just assumed that what was going on wasn’t something that happened all the time and made decisions based on that. <br>
“We’ll give you a ride home, and hopefully we can answer some of the questions that are probably popping inside your head.” <br>
Levi did hesitate for a bit, but his decision was to accept their offer. Even though he had never met them before, he wasn’t feeling uneasy anymore and the man in front of him gave off an aura that made you want to trust everything he said. <br>
It looks like they had parked nearby. The vehicle wasn’t super new, but it wasn’t exactly old either. Just like any other car you would see someone from the working class to drive. <br>
If their specialty was to blend in to this city, Levi could tell. There was nothing suspicious about them. Well, except for the fact that they showed up to where he was once he stopped running and their claim of knowing everything that had just occurred. <br>
The Car took off and the awkward silence ended when the girl turned to me and said “my name is Naomi, and the guy next to me is Benjamin.” <br>
“I’m Levi” Though you probably already know that, he thought to himself. <br>
“Just to confirm, you were chased around by two big guys wearing black suits and a green shirt, is that correct?” <br>
That was surprisingly specific. <br>
“Yeah.” <br>
“Those guys were sent there to kidnap you” <br>
Levi’s mind screamed “Yeah I could tell.” Instead, he said “But why?” <br>
He was just a normal person, well he was at least nothing special about him. So why were some random people who look like they’re apart of some sort of huge organization trying to catch him? <br>
“The answer to that is you.” <br>
Levi thought to himself again that there wasn’t anything special about him. <br>
“What do you mean?” <br>
“It means you’re not normal” Naomi cut in. <br>
“....” <br>
“I think he needs a better explanation than that Naomi” Benjamin looked at her and said, while gesturing that she should take control of the explaining and the conversation. <br>
“Let’s see, Levi look at your shirt.” <br>
Oh yeah, it had blood but it wasn’t his own, it couldn’t be since he wasn’t injured. <br>
“That blood, you probably already noticed, it isn’t yours. It belongs to one of the thugs who tried to take you with them.” <br>
“!!!” <br>
“Think about it for a bit, how did you escape from them?” <br>
Levi thought back to the attempts he made to escape, he was successful in freeing himself from the first guy, but what about the other? It’s obvious that he escaped since he was here know, but how did he accomplish that-wait! He remembered now, his mind went blank at that moment. <br>
“The reason you were able to escape is the reason why they were after you in the first place. It’s also the reason you made it this far out when you thought you were just running around.” <br>
Levi didn’t remember doing it, but he did know that at the moment his mind went blank the pushed off the man with his hand and felt a weird impact. Then suddenly nothing was holding on to him anymore. <br>
“You have something that sets you apart from the rest. It isn’t your personality nor any significant traits, it’s something else that let you do what is normally thought of as impossible. It’s because people are started to realize that about you that you were attacked tonight, and it’s also the reason why we came to meet with you.” <br>
“Our organization sent us to meet with you in order to keep you from those people who met today, and to help you realize the hidden skill that you have.” Benjamin spoke again. <br>
During this whole time Levi didn’t say a word. He didn’t know what to say, this words that were just casually coming out of the mouths of these people, frankly, they were hard to believe. But he didn’t feel like they were lying, in fact, something was telling him that he should believe them. So he decided to keep what they said in mind. <br>
The rest of the car ride was spent in silence. But this time it didn’t feel as awkward as before. <br>
The car pulled over just in front of his house. <br>
Just before he got out, Benjamin told him that they would meet again at a later time. <br>
With that, the car drove off and Levi went to his house. <br>
He was sort of wondering if the guys from before were still hiding somewhere getting ready to jump out as soon as he was close enough, but Levi just kept that in the back of his mind. Benjamin did say that those guys wouldn’t stick round and weren’t going to show up anytime soon. <br>
Levi had to jump the fence to his backyard, he hadn’t planned on leaving so he didn’t take the keys to his house. But he had left the back door open when he was taking out the garbage earlier. So he went through the back. <br>
Levi laid down that night having chance to finally relax on his bad and rest. <br>
There were still many questions and doubts in his mind, but there wasn’t any way to answer them at the moment, so he shut his eyes and let his day end. <br>
